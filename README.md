This is a web application that allows for farmers to sell their by product online, broaden their outreach and allow for people to have access to locally grown organic food. This allows viewers to sign up using two roles, farmers or sellers and users. The respective fields have their own dashboards and navigations to allow for smooth operation. The user is able to view the extensive list of products available, place orders and do transactions. The farmers get to keep clean track of the orders recieved, transactions made and weekly monthly metrics to efficiently manage the farm to customer workflow.
